Idea_1: A Latin-Square type game:
      A latin square has n rows and n columns, and each symbol may occur only once in each
      Latin Square example:
            A     D     C     B
            C     A     B     D
            B     C     D     A
            D     B     A     C     
      Futoshiki (https://www.futoshiki.org/), aka Unequal, is the inspiration for this idea.
      Inequality symbols are used 
      
      Potential Issues: Generating arrays automatically, so may have to design arrays automatically.
      
      
Idea_2: Quiz
       Perhaps a capital to country pair game.
       User presented w/ capital --> selects country from list.
       Pair quiz example:
            Paramaribo is the capital of [Guyana]/[Azerbaijan]/[Suriname]/[Panama]
